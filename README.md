### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<br/>

I am a Data Scientist at adidas in Amsterdam where I work on demand forecasting. Prior to joining adidas, I completed my Engineering Doctorate (Eng.D.) in Data Science at Eindhoven University of Technology, where I worked on data science projects for multiple companies: ASML (2x), Van Lanschot, TE Connectivity, Heijmans, and FIOD-Belastingdienst (final project). Before the EngD, I conducted deep learning research focusing on anomaly detection in time series data and completed my Masterâ€™s and Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico. I am broadly interested in the field of machine learning and its endless applications and passionate about turning cutting-edge research into products.

In my free time, I enjoy working out, meeting friends, traveling, and cooking new dishes.

Feel free to reach out to me with any queries!
